Analytical Geometry, also known as Coordinate Geometry, is a branch of mathematics that merges algebraic techniques with geometric concepts. It provides a powerful framework for studying geometric shapes and figures using coordinates and equations. Developed in the 17th century by Ren√© Descartes, this discipline revolutionized the way mathematicians approach geometry by introducing a systematic method to represent geometric objects using algebraic equations. By assigning coordinates to points, lines, curves, and shapes, analytical geometry enables precise descriptions, measurements, and analyses of geometric phenomena. Its applications span various fields, including physics, engineering, computer graphics, and many areas of science and technology.
