The resolution of irrational inequalities follow this steps

For sign < sqrt(Ax) < Bx is equivalent to system A(x) >= 0, B(x) > 0, A(x)< (B(x))**2

is sign is <= symply add B(x) >= 0, A(x)<= (B(x))**2

example sqrt(5-x) < x+1 solution are 1<x<=5

For sign > or >= example sqrt(-2x+7) > x-2 system are x-2<0 x-2>=0 -2x+7>=0 -2x+7>(x-2)**2 the final solution is x < 3 For sign >= symply add x-2<0 x-2>=0 -2x+7>=0 -2x+7 >= (x-2)**2
